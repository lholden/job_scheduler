A simple cron-like job scheduling library for Rust.

## Usage

Please see the [Documentation](https://docs.rs/job_scheduler/) for more details.

Be sure to add the job_scheduler crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
job_scheduler = "*"
```

Creating a schedule for a job is done using the `FromStr` impl for the
`Schedule` type of the [cron](https://github.com/zslayton/cron) library.

The scheduling format is as follows:

```text
sec   min   hour   day of month   month   day of week   year
*     *     *      *              *       *             *
```

Time is specified for `UTC` and not your local timezone. Note that the year may
be omitted.

Comma separated values such as `5,8,10` represent more than one time value. So
for example, a schedule of `0 2,14,26 * * * *` would execute on the 2nd, 14th,
and 26th minute of every hour.

Ranges can be specified with a dash. A schedule of `0 0 * 5-10 * *` would
execute once per hour but only on day 5 through 10 of the month.

Day of the week can be specified as an abbreviation or the full name. A
schedule of `0 0 6 * * Sun,Sat` would execute at 6am on Sunday and Saturday.

A simple usage example:

```rust
use job_scheduler::{JobScheduler, Job};
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let mut sched = JobScheduler::new();

    sched.add(Job::new("1/10 * * * * *".parse().unwrap(), || {
        println!("I get executed every 10 seconds!");
    }));

    loop {
        sched.tick();

        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
    }
}
```
